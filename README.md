# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the Python Data Structures and Algorithms repository! This project serves as a comprehensive guide and implementation resource for various data structures and algorithms using Python. It's designed for learners and practitioners interested in computer science fundamentals, coding interviews, and algorithmic problem-solving.

## Features

- **Big O Analysis**: Detailed explanations and examples of Big O notation, time complexity, and space complexity.
- **Arrays**: Implementation and manipulation of arrays, along with common operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
- **Stacks, Queues, Dequeue**: Concepts and implementation of stacks, queues, and double-ended queues (dequeue) with real-world examples.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked list implementations, along with operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and sorting.
- **Recursion**: Exploration of recursive algorithms with examples such as factorial calculation, Fibonacci series, and more.
- **Trees**: Detailed study of tree structures including binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and tree traversal algorithms (in-order, pre-order, post-order).
- **Searching and Sorting**: Implementation of major searching and sorting algorithms like linear search, binary search, quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, etc.
- **Graphs**: Comprehensive coverage of graph theory concepts, graph representations, and algorithms like depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy (for some array operations)

## Getting Started

### Installation
